# Enhancement Three: Databases 

  My artifact is an Android application and a serverside program, designed to integrate with my workplaces current data recording system. The goal of this artifact is to enable users to seamlessly scan and record accurate job times from their phone. I created this artifact about one week before beginning the course so it was still in its infancy when I planned these enhancments.\
  \
  I chose this artifact because it displays my abilities to create a real-world application that integrates current systems. The Adnroid application allowed me to shocase my abilities to use a SQLite database. While the serverside program utilized a standard mySQL databse with a mariaDB server. The SQLite Database stored dynamic data for user viewing purposes while the standard MySQL database stored manufacturing part descriptions and labor times. Using this data I was able to use a machine learning algorithm to model how the features relate to runtime. As you cna imagine, the value of being able to get more accurate quotes to customers is incredibly imortant for both a manufacturer's standpoint and the customer's.\

  	While I have had experience using databases, this was the first time I had complete control over design making the datatypes needed and how to then use them for further analysis. One of the most important things I had learned creating this enhancment was how to apply data, no matter the type, to solve a problem. THe only challenge I faced was getting the data formatted to use in machine learning algorithms. Other than that I jsut had to devlop CRUD functions to utilize the databases and apply these appropriately. In the end,  I was successful and developed a solid database and an analysis program that could provide valuable business information to my employer.
