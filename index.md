<p id="aboutMeParagraph"> Hi, my name is Adam Diamond, I have spent six years employed as a Machinist and am looking to make career
    switch into Software Engineering. I discovered my passion for programming and computers in general around four
    years ago, and have since attended college, while working full-time, with the dream of switching careers to Software
    Engineering. </p>
