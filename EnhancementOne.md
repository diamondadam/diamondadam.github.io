# Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering 

  My artifact is an Android application designed to integrate with my workplaces current data recording system. The goal of this artifact is to enable users to seamlessly scan and record accurate job times from their phone. I created this artifact about one week before beginning the cours so it was still in its infancy when I planned these enhancments.\
  \
  I chose this artifact because it displays my abilities to create a real-world application that integrates current systems. The barcode scanner showcases my ability to understand and implements a third-party API. The SQLite database showcases my ability to dynamically store and display data as it is created and deleted for users. Finally, the artifact showcases my abilities to create a user friendly and easy to use application, that accurately stores valuable business information.\
  \
  When I selected this artifact, the overall design was a mess. This was because I needed to quickly develop an example for my boss to see that I could create an app. After getting his approval to work on in my spare time, I able to rapidly develop it with the using the software design documents I devloped early on(pseudocode and flowcharts).\
  \
  The knowledge I gained implementing these enahncments is invaluable. While I have had some experiance devloping andorid applications and other programs. Noneof that compared to creating an application for a real-world system. I re-learned java skills, and most improtantly I greatly enhanced my own problem sovling skills. Especially, when its came to the design and engineering sections of this project. It was easy to make a rough outline of how the project should work but when major roadblocks are hit. When this occcured I would not only have to find a way to solve the problem, but also find the best solution that would fit into my design plans. These challneges includes not able to render javascript inside an android app, having to accoutn for lag time between servers and still provide a user-friendly experiance, and having to keep multiple databases synchronized. When recieving feedback from my Professor I always made sure to listen follow his suggestions.\

 As I mentioned when I started working on this artifact the project was in its infancy. It had a sign in page and a class for interacting with the webserver. I enhancmened it by implementing a MVVM format and organizing the project in general. I devloped models for organizing data and I developed handlers for integrating server interactions and SQLite interactions. Finally, I greatly enhanced the suer experiance by adding more than just a sign in screen there are now multiple screens that each provide a function for the user.
