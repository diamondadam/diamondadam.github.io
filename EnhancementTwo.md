# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Stuctures 

  My artifact is an Android application designed to integrate with my workplaces current data recording system, in addition there is a serverside artifiact that handles that interaction. The goal of this artifact is to enable users to seamlessly scan and record accurate job times from their phone. I created this artifact about one week before beginning the course so it was still in its infancy when I planned these enhancments.\
  \
  I chose this artifact because it displays my abilities to create a real-world application that integrates current systems. This android application and servside program both showcase my ability too devlop algorithms to parse valuable data out of the manufacting descriptions and html pages. In addition, it allows me to showcase my ability to take that valuable data and transform it into a form understandable for machine learning algorithms.\
  \
  	One of the first tings I discovered ini this endeavor was the usefulenss of pseudocode. HAving previously defined my algorithms with it implementing them became much easier and faster. While previously I had little experience using regex expressions to parse data, I now can confidently use the libraries in both java and python. In addition, one of most important skills I have learned throughout the development process is how to develop efficient and accurate algorithms for a real-world problem. It is one thing to practice through tutorials and it is another to apply your knowledge to a live data set. As for data strucutres rather than design my own structure I instead utilized one the ArrayList strucutre extensively throughout my Android Application. One of the main challenges I faced in creating and enhancing these algorithms was finding the useful data in the massive amount of html. In addtion, how to efficiently find and store manufacturing part features without using an excessive amount of if statements and other conditions.
