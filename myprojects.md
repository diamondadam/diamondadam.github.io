# My Projects 
## Workplace Data Collection and Analysis System
##### [Data Entry Android Application](https://github.com/diamondadam/CustomTool)
In the above repository I built an android application to interact with a workplace server for logging times. For instance, in the manufacturing shop this was designed for, there were barcodes on workplace documents designating operations to be logged into. With this application a user would be able to simply scan a barcode and log in remotely, rather than using a terminal that could be a significant distance away. I created this in the hopes that workers would more accurately record job times, since previously they would not. [Example Screens can be found here.](https://diamondadam.github.io/samples)

##### [Data Analysis Program](https://github.com/diamondadam/DataAnalysis)
This program connects with the database on the server. It then encodes the various features as integers and uses k-closest neighbors to find the most similar part previously ran. Using this I was able to estimate the setup and runtimes for various parts based just off of their features.

## Databases Mongo and SQLite
##### [Mongo Database and RESTful API](https://github.com/diamondadam/Mongo-Database-and-RESTful-Api)
In this repository I have a simple Python file that showcases some of my skills utilizing third-party APIs and interacting with a Mongo Database. In addition to being able to interact with a Mongo Database, the [Custom Tool and Grinding App](https://github.com/diamondadam/CustomTool) utilizes Room to create and manage a SQLite database. 

## OpenGL-Project
##### [OpenGL Project](https://github.com/diamondadam/OpenGL-Project)
While my artistic abilities are questionable, this repository showcases my skills using C++ and third-party APIs. Inside the main C++ file I use OpenGL to create and render a 3D object in this case a butter knife.
